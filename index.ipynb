The idea is to see if the difference between the two **original** samples is statistically significant. If similar differences can be observed through the random generation of samples, then the observed differences are not actually significant.\n\n\nWrite a function to perform bootstrap sampling. The function should take in two samples A and B. The two samples need not be the same size. From this, create a universal sample by combining A and B. Then, create a resampled universal sample of the same size using random sampling with replacement. Finally, split this randomly generated universal set into two samples which are the same size as the original samples, A and B. The function should return these resampled samples.\n\nExample:\n\n```python\n\nA = [1,2,3]\nB = [2,2,5,6]\n\nUniversal_Set = [1,2,2,2,3,5,6]\nResampled_Universal_Set = [6, 2, 3, 2, 1, 1, 2] # Could be different (randomly generated with replacement)\n\nResampled_A = [6,2,3]\nResampled_B = [2,1,1,2]\n```"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\ndef bootstrap(set1, set2):\n    # Your code here\n    set_uni=np.array(set1+set2)\n    n=len(set_uni)\n    resamp_uni = np.random.choice(set_uni, size=n, replace=True)\n    resamp1 = resamp_uni[:len(set1)]\n    resamp2 = resamp_uni[len(set1):]\n    return resamp1, resamp2\n# bootstrap([1,2],[3])","execution_count":1,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Jackknife \n\nWrite a function that creates additional samples by removing one element at a time.

Below are two samples A and B. The samples are mock data for the blood pressure of sample patients. The research study is looking to validate whether there is a statistical difference in the blood pressure of these two groups using a 5% significance level.  First, calculate the mean blood pressure of each of the two samples. Then, calculate the difference of these means. From there, use your `combT()` function, defined above, to generate all the possible combinations of the entire sample data into A-B splits of equivalent sizes as the original sets. For each of these combinations, calculate the mean blood pressure of the two groups and record the difference between these sample means. The full collection of the difference in means between these generated samples will serve as the denominator to calculate the p-value associated with the difference between the original sample means.\n\nFor example, in our small handwritten example above:\n\n$\\mu_a = \\frac{1+2+2}{3} = \\frac{5}{3}$  \nand  \n$\\mu_b = \\frac{1+3}{2} = \\frac{4}{2} = 2$  \n\nGiving us\n\n$\\mu_a - \\mu_b = \\frac{5}{3} - 2 = \\frac{1}{2}$\n\nIn comparison, for our various combinations we have:\n\n([1,2,2], [1,3]):  $\\mu_a - \\mu_b = \\frac{5}{3} - 2 = \\frac{1}{2}$  \n([1,2,3], [1,2]):  $\\mu_a - \\mu_b = 2 - \\frac{3}{2} = \\frac{1}{2}$  \n([1,2,1], [2,3]):  $\\mu_a - \\mu_b = \\frac{4}{3} - \\frac{5}{3} = -\\frac{1}{2}$  \n([1,1,3], [2,2]):  $\\mu_a - \\mu_b = \\frac{5}{3} - 2 = \\frac{1}{2}$  \n([2,2,3], [1,1]):  $\\mu_a - \\mu_b = \\frac{7}{3} - 1 = \\frac{4}{3}$  \n\nA standard hypothesis test for this scenario might be:\n\n$H_0: \\mu_a = \\mu_b$  \n$H_1: \\mu_a < \\mu_b$  \n  \nThus comparing our sample difference to the differences of our possible combinations, we look at the number of experiments from our combinations space that were the same or greater than our sample statistic, divided by the total number of combinations. In this case, 4 out of 5 of the combination cases produced the same or greater differences in the two sample means. This value .8 is a strong indication that we cannot refute the null hypothesis for this instance."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"a = [109.6927759 , 120.27296943, 103.54012038, 114.16555857,\n       122.93336175, 110.9271756 , 114.77443758, 116.34159338,\n       112.66413025, 118.30562665, 132.31196515, 117.99000948]\nb = [123.98967482, 141.11969004, 117.00293412, 121.6419775 ,\n       123.2703033 , 123.76944385, 105.95249634, 114.87114479,\n       130.6878082 , 140.60768727, 121.95433026, 123.11996767,\n       129.93260914, 121.01049611]","execution_count":4,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Your code here\n# ⏰ Expect your code to take several minutes to run\na_bar = np.mean(a)\nb_bar = np.mean(b)\ndiff1 = b_bar-a_bar\ncombs = combT(a,b)\ncomb_means_diff = []\nfor comb in combs:\n    abar = np.mean(comb[0])\n    bbar = np.mean(comb[1])\n    delta = bbar-abar\n    comb_means_diff.append(delta)\nncombs = len(comb_means_diff)\nnumerator = 0\nfor c in comb_means_diff:\n    if c >= diff1:\n        numerator+=1\nproportion = numerator/ncombs\nproportion","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"proportion","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## T-test revisited\n\nThe parametric statistical test equivalent to our permutation test above would be a t-test of the two groups.
